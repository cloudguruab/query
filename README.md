## How To Use It

You can **just fork or clone** this repository and use it as is.

✨ It just works. ✨

### How to contribute

**commit messages**

```
new - newly implemented user-facing features
chg - changes in existing user-facing features
fix - user-facing bugfixes
oth - other changes which users should know about
dev - any developer-facing changes, regardless of
      new/chg/fix status
```

### Configure

You can then update configs in the `.env` files to customize your configurations.

Before deploying it, make sure you change at least the values for:

- `SECRET_KEY`
- `FIRST_SUPERUSER_PASSWORD`
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

You can (and should) pass these as environment variables from secrets.

Read the [deployment.md](./deployment.md) docs for more details.

### Generate Secret Keys

Some environment variables in the `.env` file have a default value of `changethis`.

You have to change them with a secret key, to generate secret keys you can run the following command:

```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_urlsafe(32))"
```

Copy the content and use that as password / secret key. And run that again to generate another secure key.

- `project_name`: (default: `"FastAPI Project"`) The name of the project, shown to API users (in .env).
